# Type/Code frontend dev exercise
​
## To Develop Locally
​
From the root, run `npm install`.

This project uses the npm package `json-server`. To install, run `npm install -g json-server`.

Still in the root directory, run `npm run data` to serve the JSON data (`assets/data/story.json`) (via the installed `json-server` package). You can view the data at `localhost:3000/api/frames`.

Open a new tab in your terminal and run `npm run start` to view the app at `localhost:8080`.
